## Overview

The visual aspect of cities has been an important topic in urban studies since the late 19th century. In recent decades, hybrid sensing techniques and ad hoc sensor deployments have enabled cities to generate vast amounts of visual data. With advances in geo-spatial analysis, researchers can now analyse visibility of physical environment and quantify human spatial cognition, perception, socioeconomic conditions, and movement dynamics in unprecedented ways.

Although numerous studies have utilised visual data, the methodologies for conceptually quantifying the physical and perceptual factors of urban spaces are not yet fully established. This workshop will explore how the quantification of visual information can be systematically applied to deepen our understanding of the relationship between humans and place.

It will introduce participants to powerful analytical tools based on urban imagery, network analysis, and spatial openness measurement, and explain how these tools have been assessed by behavioural experiments essential for understanding visual perception, visibility, visual information and additional wellbeing parameters.

Participants will engage in hands-on activities including the analysis of sample urban environments using specialised software. They will also have the opportunity to discuss how visual intelligence can inform the design of inclusive, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing urban spaces.

## Technical Requirements

**POI VizNet** tutorial will require QGIS, which can be downloaded here:  
https://qgis.org/download/  
And the plugin:  
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/poi_visibility_network/

**SOI/USOI** demonstrations will use Rhino and Grasshopper. You can download an evaluation version of Rhino (valid for 90 days):  
https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/evaluation/  
Grasshopper is built into Rhino.

> Please download and install all the software tools before the workshop.
